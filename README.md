# image-hoarders-suite

Two things are currently here. One is a customized (as far as I remember?) version of a Tampermonkey script that I have used on Twitter for like ten years. It 'promotes' images you right click and open into a new tab, changing whatever goofy bullshit that Twitter does with an :orig image, uncompressed, as it was uploaded.

The SECOND thing is a (as far as I can tell?) MIT-licensed Chrome extension that has VANISHED, and nobody could make it work again. Well, I had a copy that worked. And you're about to get it, toot. :3

For the Save Tabbed Images Chrome extension, just download the zip and unzip it and drop that shit (the 0.70 folder or whatever) into your Chrome:extensions tab with the Developer mode on. Should work fine. You can unzip it and try it as well, and you can replace the images used. Pretty simple to customize!


******
Instructionaters:

- Go to chrome://extensions/
- turn Developer Mode on
- Unzip Save-Tabbed-Images-orig-gutted.zip because Chrome is mean and doesn't like my zip ;w;
- Drag and drop the 0.70 folder into there (it's in the zip)
- Turn that fucker on
- Pin that shit to your toolbar
CONGRATULATIONS FUCKER YOU CAN FUCKIN' DOWNLOAD ALL THE IMAGES NOW!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!! :3c
