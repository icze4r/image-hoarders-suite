# image-hoarders-suite

Two things are currently here. One is a customized version of a Tampermonkey script that I have used on Twitter for like ten years. It 'promotes' images you right click and open into a new tab, changing whatever goofy bullshit that Twitter does with an :orig image, uncompressed, as it was uploaded.

The SECOND thing is a (as far as I can tell?) MIT-licensed Chrome extension that has VANISHED, and nobody could make it work again. Well, I had a copy that worked. And you're about to get it, toot. :3

For the Save Tabbed Images Chrome extension, just download the zip and drop that shit into your Chrome:extensions tab with the Developer mode on. Should work fine. You can unzip it and try it as well, and you can replace the images used. Pretty simple to customize!
